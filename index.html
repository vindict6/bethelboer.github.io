      <h1>Portales Farmer's Market</h1>
      <p class="subtitle"><b>30 Years Strong in the Heart of Downtown Portales</b></p>
    </header>

    <article>
      
		<p class="lead">August is designated as a time to recognize and celebrate Farmers’ Markets on a national
		level. The Portales Farmers Market, which commenced operations in 1995, continues to
		thrive three decades later. As members of the Portales Farmers Market, we wish to
		highlight aspects of the history and heritage associated with vegetable farming and
		markets in Roosevelt County. Key individuals involved in establishing the market include
		local growers C.M. Baker, Larry and Margie Plummer, and County Extension Agent Floyd
		McAlister.</p>
		<p>The City of Portales, led by Mayor Don Davis, designated the former fire station property at
		First Street and Avenue B as the site for the Portales Farmer’s Market. With financial
		support from grants and beautification programs, the city added brick planters, planted
		trees, and installed signage to establish the area as the permanent market location. Local
		growers and customers were welcomed to the downtown area twice weekly to sell produce
		through the newly established market. Many residents attended every market, not only to
		purchase delicious fresh produce, but to visit with old and new neighbors.</p>
		
		<p>The market has seen many changes in 30 years. Different vendors and tons of produce
		have passed through the Portales Farmers Market. Programs to help feed children and
		seniors have been added. Bakery items, eggs and unique veggies have found their way into
		the market. One thing remains unchanged, these regular market gatherings continue to
		foster a sense of fellowship and provide ongoing access to quality, locally sourced produce
		in the heart of downtown Portales.</p>
		
		<p>The current vendors at the Portales Farmer’s Market uphold the longstanding tradition of
		vegetable farming in this region. Many of our members represent multiple generations of
		Roosevelt County farmers. We welcome the opportunity to introduce ourselves and share
		aspects of our individual backgrounds.</p>
		
		<p><b><center>Bethel Boer Farm Stand - Chris & Suzi Visser</center></b></p>

		<p>My name is Suzanne Visser. With our grandsons' births, our family now spans seven
		generations in Roosevelt County. Hugh Jacob Mathis settled in Portales in the early 1900s.
		His son, Brice Mathis – my great uncle- became well known in the Portales area for his
		contributions to vegetable farming over several decades. He is frequently remembered for
		his generosity, permitting widows and those experiencing hardship to glean from his fields,
		thereby providing vital sustenance to those in need prior to the development of government
		assistance programs.</p>
		
		<p>Growing up, my parents farmed vegetables and sold eggs locally, sparking my interest in
		gardening. My first job as a teenager was planting sweet potatoes for Newberry Farms.
		After years away from farming, I returned to agriculture in 2018 when I married a Dutch
		dairyman.</p>
		
		<p>Chris relocated to Portales and established E&C Dairy (later known as Parkland Dairy) in
		1989. With access to acreage, he quickly developed a love for growing and harvesting his
		own forages. He retired from the dairy industry in 2021, and together we created Bethel
		Boer Farm Stand. The name Bethel Boer derives from our location in what was once
		Bethel, New Mexico, and the Dutch word “Boer,” meaning “farmer.” Thus, Chris is known
		as “the Dutch farmer at Bethel.”</p>
		
		<p>Since 2024, we have actively participated in local Farmer’s Markets. Bethel Boer is
		dedicated to promoting sustainable, community-oriented vegetable cultivation through the
		implementation of controlled environment agriculture (CEA) and targeted drip irrigation
		techniques, supporting regional water conservation initiatives.</p>

		<p><b><center>Ledbetter Chili - Rick & Evelyn Ledbetter</center></b></p>
		
		<p>Rick Ledbetter has benefited from a rich farming heritage, having worked alongside both his
		father and grandfather. The name Z-7 Farms originates from his grandfather’s cattle brand,
		symbolizing the family’s commitment to agricultural excellence. With over five decades of
		farming experience, Rick has cultivated a diverse range of crops including peanuts,
		potatoes, green beans, peas, cotton, forages, and carrots for color extraction; however,
		green chili remains his principal crop. His wife, Evelyn, has provided support throughout
		their forty-one years together on the farm. Ledbetter’s green chili enjoys a strong reputation
		in Eastern New Mexico and West Texas and is distributed across various states. His
		distinctive “I Got Roasted by Ledbetter Chili” logo has been a prominent feature at Farmer’s
		Markets in Clovis and Portales for two decades, attracting numerous customers seeking
		freshly roasted chili.</p>

		<p><b><center>Microgreens - Tim Lutz</center></b></p>
		<p>Tim relocated from the Midwest to Portales four years ago, bringing with him a distinctive
		skill set. He cultivates 12 varieties of microgreens indoors using non-GMO seeds,
		harvesting them each week. These fresh greens are available at the Portales Thursday
		Market and the Saturday Morning Clovis Farmer’s Market.</p>

		<p>For those unfamiliar, “microgreens” are vegetables and herb plants grown for only 8-12
		days; unlike sprouts, they are cut above the root, typically as their second set of leaves
		emerges. Rich in vitamins, nutrients, and antioxidants—often in concentrations exceeding
		those found in mature plants—microgreens can be used independently or as an addition to
		salads, wraps, cold dishes, and stir fry recipes.
		Microgreens by Tim are carefully packaged and ready for immediate consumption, making
		it easy to incorporate beneficial nutrients into your diet.</p>
		
		<p><b><center>MTA Farm - Mark & Tomie Anthony</center></b></p>

		<p>MTA is an acronym for Mark & Tomie Anthony. Mark wanted to garden all his life but growing
		up in Elida the lack of water and topsoil prevented it. Mark’s great grandfather
		homesteaded south of Elida in 1902; the property is still in the family.</p>

		<p>In 1990, Mark's employment with the John Deere dealership prompted a move from Clovis
		to Muleshoe, where he was permitted to cultivate a garden on the dealership property. The
		harvest was generously shared among colleagues, family members, and several senior
		residents of Muleshoe. In 2016, Tomie became involved and actively participated in
		gardening activities. Following a change in ownership at the dealership in 2017, Mark
		accepted an offer to return to Clovis.</p>
		
		<p>The Anthony’s purchased a ten-acre property in Clovis and started a garden in 2018
		continuing their tradition of distributing produce as they had in Muleshoe. Subsequently,
		the idea of selling at the local farmer’s market arose. During the pandemic-related closure
		of Mother’s Day Out daycare in 2020, Tomie assumed responsibility for sales at the Clovis
		Farmers Market. Mark remained employed with John Deere, meeting Tomie at the market
		after work on Tuesdays and attending Saturday markets.</p>

		<p>In April 2022, Mark opted for early retirement to dedicate himself fully to managing the
		garden. His cousins, Dink and Susan Looney also began assisting with both gardening and
		farmers’ market operations. Their collective efforts have been instrumental to the success
		of these initiatives.</p>

		<p>MTA Farms has approximately 1.25 acres of garden space and cultivates a wide variety of
		plants. The farm includes a 30x96 hoop house and uses drip irrigation to efficiently
		distribute water. A beehive was added last year with the aim of learning about beekeeping
		and supporting pollination in the garden. If this initiative proves successful, additional
		beehives may be introduced and honey harvesting considered.</p>

		<p><b><center>Rustic Rooster - Alan & Natalie Michael</center></b></p>
		<p>My name is Natalie Michael. I came to New Mexico for a vacation to visit my now husband
		Alan in 2011 and never left! In 2013 Alan and I were introduced to foster care. We became
		foster parents and quickly grew as a family. Eventually we ended up adopting seven
		amazing children to complete our family. Having so many people to cook for was a big
		reason for me to improve my skills in the kitchen. I found a real love for cooking and that I
		was pretty good at baking. Over the years, I went from a CNA to a stay-at-home mom. I
		really love the life we built, and Roosevelt County was a perfect place to raise all my
		beautiful kids. I started my farmers market journey this year and really enjoy it! I love being
		able to share my love for baking with the community. As with everything in my life it was all
		God’s timing, and I look forward to seeing where this new journey takes me!</p>

		<p><b><center>Veggie Shack - Margie Plummer & Mark Balko</center></b></p>

		<p>Our family has a long-standing tradition of farming in Roosevelt County, with our
		grandparents and parents having established deep agricultural roots in the region. Both we
		and subsequent generations have grown up immersed in farm life. In the early 1990s, we
		expanded our produce acreage significantly, initially lacking a defined marketing strategy.
		This led us to begin selling at the Clovis Farmer’s Market. Following further research and
		collaboration among interested participants, the Portales Farmer’s Market was established
		in 1995. This development marked the start of operating four markets weekly from July
		through October. Over the years, our cultivation efforts have ranged from two to thirty
		acres.</p>
		
		<p>In the mid-2000s, we acquired the Melrose Fruit Market from Ruby Stephenson. By 2012, we
		relocated our garden operations to “Turnbough’s Corner” at the intersection of Highway 70 and
		Roosevelt Roads 3 & P. Revitalizing this location after several years of vacancy required
		substantial effort to prepare both the land and store for business.</p>

		<p>Initially, we intended to maintain both Melrose and Portales locations; however, the
		logistics of transporting produce multiple times per week proved challenging. Thus, since
		2016, we have operated exclusively at the Portales site. Our operations now include an onsite farm store, a greenhouse for spring bedding plants, thirty acres dedicated to
		vegetables, and participation in four farmers’ markets each week. As owners of The Veggie
		Shack, Margie Plummer and Mark Balko sincerely appreciate the support of our customers
		and the friendships formed over the years. We look forward to continuing to serve the
		community for many more years to come (but probably not 30 more).</p>

		<p>Margie Plummer is the Market Manager for Roosevelt and Curry County Farmer’s Market.
		The Portales Market board consists of Rick Ledbetter, Mark Balko, and Chris Visser. For
		information about participating in the Farmer’s Market or for any inquiries, contact can be
		made with any of these individuals.</p>
		
		<p>We are aware that some individuals may feel disappointed about not being able to sell
		crafts and similar items at the Portales Farmer’s Market. We would like to take this
		opportunity to clarify any potential misunderstandings regarding this matter. While the
		region offers numerous valuable opportunities for local artisans to market their products,
		the focus of the Portales Farmer’s Market is distinct. In accordance with recommendations
		from the New Mexico Farmer’s Market Association and our own local bylaws, the Portales
		Farmer’s Market is committed to prioritizing locally grown produce and baked goods.</p>

		<p>To be eligible for sale at the Market, items other than baked goods, eggs, fruits & vegetables
		must consist of at least 75% of locally sourced ingredients (for example - goat soap made
		from milk produced by your own goats). This policy supports the Market’s mission to
		provide a unique platform where local farmers can engage directly with the community and
		offer access to fresh, local products. Furthermore, adherence to these guidelines enables
		participation in programs such as the Senior Farmer’s Market, WIC, and SNAP/Double Up,
		ensuring broader benefits for both vendors and customers.</p>
		
		<p>We cordially invite you to visit and support locally grown New Mexico produce at the
		Farmer’s Market, held on Mondays and Thursdays starting at 5:00 pm. The market is
		located at the corner of First Street and Avenue B in Portales.</p>
